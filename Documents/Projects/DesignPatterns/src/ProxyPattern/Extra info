# Applicability

Proxy is applicable whenever there is a need for a more versatile or sophisticated
reference to an object than a simple pointer. Here are several common situations
in which the Proxy pattern is applicable

  -	Remote proxy provides a local representative for an
	object in a different address space.
  -	Virtual proxy creates expensive objects on demand.
  -	Protection proxy controls access to the original
	object. Protection proxies are useful when objects
	should have different access rights.

# Typical Use Case
	Control access to another object
	Lazy initialization
	Implement logging
	Facilitate network connection
	Count references to an object
